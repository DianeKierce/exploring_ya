# Exploring Publishing Data

In this repository, I used a small dataset about young adult books to practice exploratory data analysis, plotting with matplotlib and Seaborn, natural language processing, feature engineering, and classification modeling. I also used this data set to try out some of Tableau's functions.

This was one of my first NLP projects and one of my first experiences working with Tableau.
